### Changed since the last development build

- New package `io.github.mrxsin.youtubehideads` (was `org.youtubehideads.module`).
- Seven identical gate libraries merged into one `liband3.so`. The APK has 11 native libraries instead of 17 and is about 97 KB smaller. Behavior is unchanged.

### Verified

- Pixel 8 Pro, Android 17, YouTube 21.41.525, Vector 2.2 (libxposed API 102): all 531 startup self-checks pass and every hook installs. The installed APK matches the published SHA-256.
- Per-feature off/on UI checks were last run on development build 77 with the same policy bytes.

Other YouTube versions, devices and 32-bit/x86 ABIs are not certified. The APK is arm64-v8a only.
